# irackbot
A bot for manageble, efficient Cross-Platform Open Source Communication by relaying messages across Slack and IRC channels differently.

##Another IRC-Slack bot?

A lot of Open Source communities rely on [IRC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) for their communication. IRC's great
but let's face it, it doesn't really compare that well to modern team messaging clients like [Slack](https://slack.com/).

* A lot of your conversations are drowned and lost inbetween messages from other users discussing other issues
* It's hard to keep track of what you've discussed and keep a log of messages received.
* Proxy issues with IRC resulting in instant ban from IRC servers when you haven't done s**t (pretty common)

You could be working on a project / involved with this
community and you end up facing all these problems. So being the wannabe developer that you are, you end up building
something that solves all of these problems.

##Uhh, so what's different?

* This bot relays messages from Slack to IRC and vice-versa.<br>
*Well, that's not new.*

* You can mention users on the other platform (from Slack to IRC and vice versa) by just pinging them with their original username.<br>
*Ehh nothing new*

* You can get a list of all the users on the other platform with just a single command.<br>
*Ok not bad..*<br>

* You can configure your bot, with a single ping command, to **filter all incoming IRC communication and include only those messages
where any one of your members on the Slack channel have been mentioned**. Meanwhile, all your communication from Slack is still
relayed to IRC and everyone can see what you're discussing and reach out to you anytime.

*That's just what I need!*
